# MyFramework

<hr>

## About

So, I'm making a **PHP** framewrok having with inspiration others projetcs some Spring for Java, FastAPI for Python and Laravel for PHP itself.

Until now I don't have the intention to leave it comertial, but who knows...

I know that *MyFramework* not is the better name, but I will think in other after.

## How execute

To execute, you only have to run the comand `php -S localhost:8000` in your terminal while in the project directory

```
>>> git clone https://github.com/Yuri-Gabriel/MyFramework.git
>>> cd ./MyFramework
>>> php -S localhost:8000
```

## Requirements

- `PHP 8.0`
